Considering i got an opportunity to study at an ivy league, it was very important 
to use this opportunity well by taking the right decision. This calls us for the 
opportunities present at columbia, and how i made the most out of my time at it.

The MSDS program at columbia university has a set of 7 core courses and 3 electives.
The good dthing about this program is that it allows you to waive the core courses
if you show prior experience or good grades for similar topics covered in your previous education
I took this opportunity to waive 3 courses (3 was the max you can waive) whcih 
allowed me to take more electives and explore more topics of my interest.

Another important aspect of columbia is its location. Being in new york city,
it provides a lot of opportunities to network and find internships or jobs.
I made sure to attend various networking events, career fairs, and workshops
organized by the university to connect with professionals in my field. So now, it was
time to use the most out of columbia's location and the education program.

First Semester

IEOR8100E: Agentic AI and Data Economy: rather than going easy on the core courses,
I decided to take a challenging core course that was relevant to my interests.
This course provided insights into the intersection of AI and economics. As I had already 
worked on AI agents at scale, I managed to get in this PHD level course with just 40 people 
inside and 170+ in the waitlist (cold mailing is all it takes). This course covered 
the basics of agentics, mcp servers along with presenting a paper and submitting a final project 
as part of the grade. The good part was that we had lectures from industry experts from
companies like IBM and Ethereum which explained the potential use cases and how we could use 
Ai agents to build decentralized applications. I worked on a project on auto-refining smart contract generator.
The details of this project can be found in my projects section (https://github.com/AgenticsFintekColumbia/smart-contracts).
At the end of this course, i got an opportunity to contribute on IBM's Agentics repo
and work on their internal structure. My project, along with a few Phd student projects were selected 
to be published on columbia's official website. Sir also told that my project will be
used as a potential study material for the course for the upcoming semsesters. This led
to me getting to work as a research assistant for prof. Agostino Capponi, the course instructor for the upcoming semester.
