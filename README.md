# Personal Portfolio - Chaitya Shah

This is a website made with Vite and React. I have used Tailwind CSS for styling and used multiple 3D Three.js models. 

The Computer on the landing page, all the balls for respective skills and the rover near the contact page are 3D models.

The Contact page is integrated with Emailjs.

Multiple Three.js models could not be loaded on the mobile view, so only one model is loaded (rover). The rest are hidden and will be available on pc or any comparitively bigger device.
